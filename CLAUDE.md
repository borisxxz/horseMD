## What this is

**HorseMD** — a warm, Typora-style Markdown editor. Electron shell + Vite +
React, with **Milkdown Crepe** (ProseMirror-based WYSIWYG) as the editor engine.
Core idea: every file opens as a **tab in one window**, not a new process. The
shell (tabs, file tree, command palette, outline, themes, i18n, welcome screen)
is all hand-written.

## Commands

```bash
npm install            # if Electron download is slow: ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
npm run dev            # electron-vite dev (HMR)
npm run build          # build main + preload + renderer → out/
npm start              # run the built app
npm run dist           # build + electron-builder package for the HOST platform
npm run dist:dir       # unpacked build (no installer)
npm run guide:dev      # user tutorial site
npm run guide:check    # tutorial content checks + static build
```

`npm run dist` packages for whatever OS you run it on — **Windows NSIS** on
Windows, **macOS dmg + zip** on macOS, and **Linux amd64 deb** on Linux. Installers
must be built and validated on their target OS; a dmg must be built on macOS and
a deb must pass `dpkg-deb --info` on Linux. If the
electron-builder binaries download slowly:
`ELECTRON_BUILDER_BINARIES_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron-builder-binaries/`.

Builds are **unsigned**: Windows shows SmartScreen ("更多信息 → 仍要运行");
macOS Gatekeeper blocks first launch (right-click → Open, or
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HorseMD.app`). Linux users should
install only the `.deb` from the official GitHub Release.

## Conventions & rules

- **Cross-platform — do not break the other OS.** This app ships on Windows,
  macOS, and Linux from one codebase. Platform-specific code is gated:
  - main process: `process.platform === 'darwin' | 'win32' | 'linux'`
  - renderer: `window.api.platform` → an `.app.is-win` / `.app.is-mac` /
    `.app.is-linux` class on
    the root; write platform CSS under those selectors only.
  - title bar: `hiddenInset` + `trafficLightPosition` on macOS (top bar spans
    full width, activity bar drops below the traffic lights). On Windows the
    native `titleBarOverlay` is **disabled** — the renderer draws Windows or GTK
    minimize/maximize/close buttons (`WindowControls` in `Topbar.jsx`, gated to
    `platform === 'win32' || platform === 'linux'`), driven by `window:*` IPC; main pushes
    `window:maximized` on `maximize`/`unmaximize` so the restore icon stays in
    sync. Keep all three desktop paths working when touching the top bar, and always leave a
    draggable area even when tabs fill the strip.
  - shortcuts accept both `Ctrl` and `Cmd` (`metaKey`).
  - launch args: `extractArgs()` in `main/index.js` splits argv into markdown
    **files** (→ `open-paths`, tabs) and **folders** (→ `open-folder`, workspace
    — from the Explorer "Open with HorseMD" folder entry). Keep both handled.
- **Workspace** (`useWorkspace.js` + `useSidebarTree.js` + `Sidebar.jsx`): a SINGLE, UNNAMED
  workspace — just a bag of folder roots (`folderRoots: [abs,…]`, persisted in
  session). No name, no multi-workspace, no switching (one workspace is enough for
  a writing app; users add/remove folders within it). The sidebar head shows a
  FIXED「工作区」label (never the folder name); the file tree is **multi-root**
  (each `folderRoot` a synthetic top-level folder node reusing `renderNode`).
  "Open Folder…" (dialog, `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O`, or the Explorer folder launch)
  **adds** a folder — it does NOT replace; right-click a root node → "remove from
  workspace". `loadFolderRootsFromSession` migrates the prior multi-workspace
  shape (`workspaces:[{folderRoots}]`, merged) and the legacy single-`{workspace:
  {rootPath}}` shape losslessly. The watcher starts one `watch:start` per root
  (main's `watchers` Map is per-dir → reuses the crash-proof guards);
  `folderRoots.join('\n')` is the stable effect dep so the watcher/files effects
  don't re-run every render. Zero roots → sidebar shows an "add folder" empty
  state.
- **Markdown vs plain text.** Supported extensions are centralized:
  `MD_EXTS`/`MD_RE` in `main/index.js` (open dialog + folder scan), and
  `MD_DOC_RE` in `App.jsx`. `.md/.markdown/.mdx` open in the Crepe rich editor;
  `.txt` (and any other file with a path) opens in the **plain textarea** —
  feeding plain text through Milkdown collapses line breaks and hangs on large
  files. New untitled tabs (no path) use the rich editor. **Heavy docs**
  (> 50 K lines, > 400 K chars, or > 150 consecutive non-blank lines — see
  `isHeavyDoc` in `paths.js`) also default to the textarea; the user can opt
  into rich per-tab via the banner button. See
  [`docs/performance-large-doc.md`](./docs/performance-large-doc.md) for the
  full analysis and remaining P1/P2 optimization options.
- **ProseMirror view**: get it via `crepe.editor.ctx.get(editorViewCtx)` —
  `crepe.editor.view` is `undefined` in this Milkdown version.
- **Crepe content callback**: register `crepe.on(markdownUpdated)` **before**
  `crepe.create()`, or changes never fire (saves would write stale content).
- **Lazy-mounted editors**: a rich tab's `<Editor>` is created only on its first
  activation, then kept mounted (`mountedIds` in `App.jsx`). This keeps startup /
  session-restore fast (restoring N tabs spins up one editor, not N). Code that
  needs a tab's editor API (`editorApis[id]`) must activate the tab first — see
  `exportPathToPdf`, which opens/activates then waits for the per-tab editor API
  readiness signal before reading `getPdfSource()`.
- **Raw HTML rendering**: Milkdown's `html` node shows markup as escaped text;
  we add a ProseMirror node view (`renderHtmlNodeView` in `Editor.jsx`) that
  renders recognized block HTML (e.g. `<table>`) as real, sanitized DOM.
  Display-only — the node round-trips through `attrs.value`, so the saved Markdown
  keeps the original HTML. **Register it by appending to `nodeViewCtx`**
  (`ctx.update(nodeViewCtx, v => [...v, ['html', …]])`), NOT by setting
  `editorViewOptionsCtx.nodeViews` — the core spreads `editorViewOptionsCtx` last
  into the EditorView, so the latter would overwrite every component node view
  (image-block captions, CodeMirror, tables, list items). Same channel Milkdown's
  `$view` uses; see [implementation-notes.md](./docs/implementation-notes.md).
- **Closing the window** warns about unsaved changes: main defers `close`
  (`allowClose` guard) and sends `app-close-request`; the renderer checks dirty
  tabs and calls `confirmAppClose()` to let it close. Covers the macOS traffic
  light, the Windows close button, and Cmd/Ctrl+Q (closing a tab is separate, in
  `closeTab`).
- **App version** is injected at build time via Vite `define` (`__APP_VERSION__`
  in `electron.vite.config.mjs`, from `package.json`); shown on the welcome page.
- **Releases** (GitHub): tag = `vX.X.X`, title = **`HorseMD vX.X.X`** (all 14
  historical releases unified to this format 2026-07-04 — keep it consistent).
  Release notes: Chinese, start directly with content (no HorseMD intro),
  structured as ✨ 新功能 / 🐛 修复 / 📦 下载 + unsigned-warning + full-changelog link.
  Release versions must be monotonically greater than every build that may have
  been distributed for testing: do not publish a lower "clean" version after
  internal builds such as `0.5.29`, because auto-update compares semver and will
  treat `0.5.5` as older than `0.5.29`.
  Build full set: mac dmg+zip (arm64+x64) + win nsis x64 + Linux amd64 deb
  (`CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` for unsigned Apple builds). Linux must be
  built on Ubuntu, pass `dpkg-deb --info`, and be uploaded with
  `gh release upload "$TAG" dist/*.deb --clobber` after validation.
  `gh release create` sometimes leaves a draft (proxy flakiness) — check + `gh release edit --draft=false` to publish.
- **Split view**: `splitId` in `App.jsx` is the tab shown in the right pane
  (`split` is the live derived flag: right tab exists, differs from `activeId`,
  not on Home). The two panes are **flex siblings inside `.editor-area`** (a flex
  row) — visibility is driven by per-tab `display`/`order`, NOT by re-parenting,
  so toggling split never re-creates an editor (no Crepe re-parse). `editorHostRef`
  stays on the left/active pane (find, outline, scroll-ratio target it);
  `focusedTabRef` tracks the last-focused pane so Save/Export hit the pane you're
  editing. The right pane never shows global source mode.
- **Custom themes (Typora-compatible)**: user `.css` lives in `userData/themes`
  (scanned **recursively** — Typora themes ship as a folder); `themes:read` rewrites
  relative `url(...)` to absolute `file://` so theme fonts/images load. The CSS is
  injected via `customThemes.js` into one `<style>`; the editor content carries
  Typora's `#write` + `markdown-body` hooks so its selectors match. While a custom
  theme is active (`body.hm-has-custom-theme`) app.css yields the writing area's
  background/width AND sets content text `color: inherit` so the theme's colors win;
  the app chrome keeps its own styling. `applyTheme` preserves `hm-*` body classes.
- **Mermaid** (`editor-mermaid.js`): rendered through Crepe's **built-in code-block
  "preview" mechanism** (the same one LaTeX-style blocks would use), via
  `codeBlockConfig.renderPreview` + `previewOnlyByDefault`. A ` ```mermaid ` block
  shows only the diagram by default; the code block's own toolbar gets a Hide/Edit
  toggle next to Copy. Mermaid is `import()`-ed lazily; `ensureRender` retries once
  on a flaky first render (the lazy import can race with Mermaid's init). Do NOT
  use a custom widget decoration for this — `previewToggleText` must be set on the
  **feature** config (`featureConfigs[CrepeFeature.CodeMirror]`), not
  `codeBlockConfig`, because the feature reads it to build the toggle button.
- **Code-block eager mount** (`editor-codeblock-eager.js`, #25 root-fix): Milkdown's
  `CodeMirrorBlock` node view lazy-mounts its CodeMirror editor via an
  IntersectionObserver(200px) + 5s teardown — a plain placeholder while off-screen,
  the real editor only in view. The placeholder↔mounted height delta (~127px) is
  what scroll-anchoring can't absorb when the editor has a selection (Chromium
  disables `overflow-anchor` for a focused contenteditable w/ selection) → "scroll
  to a code block, stop, select → page jumps". We modify `CodeMirrorBlock`'s
  **prototype** (it's exported) to mount EAGERLY (`renderPlaceholder` →
  `initializeCodeMirror`) and NEVER tear down (`scheduleTeardown` → no-op),
  keeping the height stable so no delta exists. A nodeView override can't do this
  (`nodeViewCtx` adds views but can't override `$view`-registered component views;
  `editorViewOptionsCtx.nodeViews` overwrites ALL component views) — the prototype
  mod is the surgical fix. `destroy()` still cleans up directly, so no leak. If
  Milkdown adds a config flag / renames these methods, revisit.
- **Outline jump** (`useOutline.js` `jumpAndStabilize`): clicking an outline heading
  triggers a custom ease-out scroll animation (200–500ms, rAF-driven — NOT
  `behavior:'smooth'`, which is unpredictable on large docs + fights overflow-anchor),
  then polls every 200ms re-scrolling until the position stabilizes (async content
  like images/mermaid/CV keeps shifting scrollTop). `overflow-anchor` is temporarily
  disabled during the poll + restored when stable. `forcedActiveRef` overrides the
  scrollspy's active heading during the poll (the `tops` cache may be stale mid-settle).
  Large-doc chunked-load: `richLoading` gates the outline list (skeleton during load)
  + queues the jump until `richDocVersion` bumps.
- **Mode-switch (rich↔source)** — keep-mounted + block-level offset mapping; the
  design that ended the drift on large/image-dense docs (#28/#41):
  - **Crepe stays mounted in source mode** (`EditorArea.jsx`): the source
    `<textarea>` overlays a `display:none` Crepe, so switching back does NOT
    re-parse the doc or reload its images — the rich selection/scroll is retained.
  - **Source edits sync only when real** (`useSourceModeSwitch.js` `syncSourceToRich` → Editor
    `replaceMarkdown`): a source buffer equal to baseline is a no-op, so a pure
    view-toggle never dirties the doc or rebuilds Crepe. `sourceEditedIds` is the
    "edited?" signal; `sourceModeIds` makes source/rich **per-tab** (#42).
  - **Caret anchor = markdown raw-offset ↔ ProseMirror block mapping**
    (`editor-source-map.js` `markdownOffsetToPmPos` / `pmPosToMarkdownOffset`,
    via Editor `markdownOffsetFromSelection` / `restoreMarkdownOffset`). It first
    locates the BLOCK (by visible text + occurrence index), then converts the
    in-block char offset — robust against repeated words and against image/link
    atoms that make global visible-char indices diverge between modes.
  - **Follow vs keep by caret visibility** (`useSourceModeSwitch.js` `toggleSource` + effect,
    `scrollAnchor.js` facade → `mode-caret-anchor.js`): rich caret
    visible (editing) → restore caret + follow it (scrollIntoView/focus); caret
    off-screen (reading) → keep the viewport. The textarea carries
    `__horsemdSource*` flags (selectionUser / viewportMoved / selectionAt) so a
    programmatic scroll isn't mistaken for a user scroll. `#50` keeps source
    scrollTop stable across Enter.
  - `scrollAnchor.js` is a stable facade. Implementations live in
    `mode-visible-map.js`, `mode-caret-anchor.js`, `mode-viewport-anchor.js`, and
    `mode-source-headings.js`; visible text remains a fallback path. Full
    post-mortem + design: `docs/handoff-mode-switch.md`
    (2026-07-09 entry) and `docs/editor-feature-inventory.md` §8. **CDP gotcha:** N
    tabs = N mounted editors — filter `.ProseMirror` by `offsetParent`; place
    carets with real `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` (a raw DOM selection doesn't sync
    PM state).
- **Outline in source mode** (`useOutline.js` + `scrollAnchor.parseSourceHeadings`,
  #40): the outline used to blank in source mode. Now `mode-source-headings.js`
  parses CommonMark/GFM headings from the textarea (also used by caret fallback),
  the scrollspy maps `scrollTop→char→nearest heading`,
  and `jumpToHeading` scrolls the textarea via `scrollSourceToHeading`. A textarea
  `input` listener (debounced) live-refreshes the list. Rich-mode paths are unchanged
  (all source branches are `if (sourceMode)`-gated; the `richLoading` guard became
  `!sourceMode && richLoading`, identical in rich mode).
- **Code-block Tab at cursor** (`editor-codeblock-tab.js`, #39): Crepe's code-mirror
  feature bundles `indentWithTab`, so Tab re-indented the whole line. Override =
  `Prec.highest(keymap.of([{key:'Tab',run:insertTabAtCursor}]))` injected via the
  `[CrepeFeature.CodeMirror]` featureConfig `extensions` field (the supported channel
  — the feature pushes `config.extensions` AFTER `indentWithTab`). **No prototype mod,
  no `editorViewOptionsCtx`/nodeView change** (those would clobber component node views).
  Shift-Tab (dedent) untouched; prose Tab unaffected (CM-scoped only).
- **Tab reorder** (`useFileOps.js` `reorderTabs`, #31): HTML5 drag in `Tabs.jsx`
  (draggable + onDragStart/Over/Drop/End). Close-button area cancels drag. Session
  persists tabs in array order (existing logic). Mobile skips draggable.
- **Show hidden files** (`settings.showHiddenFiles`, #29): main `showHidden` global +
  `settings:setShowHidden` IPC; `readTree`/`listFilesFlat` check it (always skip
  IGNORED_DIRS). App.jsx useEffect syncs + refreshes the tree.
- **Windows Ctrl+W** (#30): Win/Linux use a custom Window submenu (`close` binds
  `Alt+F4`, NOT `Ctrl+W`) instead of the bare `{ role:'windowMenu' }` whose injected
  `close` defaults to `CmdOrCtrl+W` (collides with Close Tab). mac keeps the bare role.
- **Highlight** (`editor-highlight.js`): `==text==` is a custom Milkdown mark
  (yellow), plus red/blue via toolbar color picker (round-trips as
  `<mark class="hm-hl-…">`). Built as `$markSchema` + a two-way remark plugin
  (`mdast-util-find-and-replace` on parse; a `highlight` stringify handler). A
  selection-toolbar color button applies it (`applyHighlightInView`); `Mod-Alt-H`
  toggles yellow. Register via `crepe.editor.use(highlightFeatures)` — the **array**
  form (editor.use keeps only its first arg), and `highlightAttr` /
  `toggleHighlightCommand` MUST be in that array or Crepe init throws
  ("Context … not found"). The inline-code `inclusive:false` fix uses the same
  `extendSchema` pattern; a belt-and-suspenders post-create override is applied too.
- **Inline HTML** (`editor-html.js`): Milkdown splits `<span>x</span>` into
  open/text/close atom nodes; `remarkMergeInlineHtml` coalesces a balanced
  open…close run into one html node so the node view can render it. Block tags →
  `hm-html-block`, safe inline tags → `hm-html-inline`, everything else → escaped
  text. Sanitized (scripts/styles/on* handlers stripped).
- **GFM autolink + non-ASCII** (`editor-autolink.js`): remark-gfm's
  autolink-literal extends a `www.`/`http://` URL across non-ASCII text (Chinese,
  full-width punctuation) because its terminator set is ASCII-only — so prose like
  `www.caixuetang.cn，中文…1` became ONE bogus link whose URL had raw non-ASCII
  chars, turning the sentence into a `[text](url)` visible in source mode.
  `remarkUnwrapNonAsciiAutolinks` (parse-side, appended to `remarkPluginsCtx` so it
  runs AFTER preset-gfm) replaces any link whose URL has non-ASCII chars with its
  own text children. Valid ASCII autolinks (`www.example.com`, `https://`) keep an
  ASCII URL → untouched. (Source mode then shows `www\.example.cn` — the `\.` is
  remark's standard escape that prevents re-autolinking on re-parse; renders as `.`.)
- **Layout settings** (`settings.js` + `LayoutControl.jsx`): font size, line
  height, paragraph spacing, and page width are CSS variables
  (`--editor-font-size` / `--editor-line-height` / `--editor-para-spacing` /
  `--editor-max-width`) applied live. The slider writes the var DIRECTLY during a
  drag (no React round-trip) and commits once on pointer-up, so reflowing the whole
  editor per tick stays smooth. `ui/AdjustGroup.jsx` is the shared control, reused by
  both `LayoutControl` (the StatusBar 排版 popover) and the Settings page.
- **Settings page** (`SettingsView.jsx`): a full-tab view opened from the
  ActivityBar gear (bottom-left) / mobile `•••` sheet. Tabs carry a `kind` field
  (`'doc'` default, `'settings'` for this page); `EditorArea` skips `kind!=='doc'`
  tabs and `App.jsx` renders `<SettingsView>` as a sibling. Settings tabs are
  transient — `useAppLifecycle` filters `kind!=='doc'` out of session persistence.
  StatusBar/SaveFab/saveTab gate on `kind!=='settings'` (no save on the page).
  StatusBar quick-controls (排版/主题/语言) stay — Settings is their full-version home.
- **Body font-size** (`.milkdown .ProseMirror p`): MUST set
  `font-size: var(--editor-font-size)`. Milkdown Crepe's `reset.css` hardcodes
  `.ProseMirror p { font-size: 16px }`; without the override the font-size slider
  only affects headings (which use `em`), not body paragraphs.
- **Spell-check** (`settings.spellcheck`, default OFF): applied as the `spellcheck`
  attribute on the Crepe `.ProseMirror` contenteditable in `Editor.jsx` (on mount +
  via effect). No IPC — the attribute is enough; all other surfaces opt out via
  `spellCheck={false}`.
- **Save**: a floating FAB (`SaveFab.jsx`) appears at the bottom-right only while
  the active tab is dirty. `usePopover` (hooks/) is the shared close-on-outside
  hook for all popovers — don't hand-roll a per-component copy (a previous one
  missed the outside-click close).
- **Slash (`/`) menu** (`editor-slash-menu.js`) is **self-built**, NOT Crepe's
  built-in BlockEdit slash. Crepe's filters items by `label.includes(filter)`
  ONLY (no keyword field), so typing past `/` (e.g. `h1`, `#`, `ol`) against the
  Chinese labels matched nothing and the menu appeared to "vanish". We keep
  `Feature.BlockEdit` ENABLED (the block drag/add handle `.milkdown-block-handle`
  is a separate slice we must preserve) but **neutralize its slash** by overriding
  the slice named `"CREPE_MENU_SLASH_SPEC"` (a `$ctx` slot whose `$prose` reads a
  PluginSpec from it) with a no-op view — `disableCrepeSlash(ctx)` in
  `editor-slash-menu.js`, called from `editor-crepe-setup.js`. Reach it by **string
  name** (`ctx.update('CREPE_MENU_SLASH_SPEC', …)`): Milkdown slice ids are
  per-call **Symbols**, so re-running `slashFactory('CREPE_MENU')` here would mint
  a different id and MISS Crepe's registered slice (→ config callback throws →
  `crepe.create()` silently rejects → editor never mounts). Our menu is a raw
  ProseMirror plugin in `prosePluginsCtx` (the channel for raw plugins; do NOT use
  `crepe.editor.use` for it) owning a `SlashProvider` for positioning; filter =
  label OR i18n keywords (`slash.kw.*`, zh+en+abbrev+symbol) ranked exact > prefix
  > substring (so `/-` → bullet's exact `-`, not divider's `---` substring); with
  a query it renders a flat ranked list, without one the grouped full menu. Insert
  semantics are byte-identical to Crepe's block-edit (`clearTextInCurrentBlockCommand`
  then `setBlockType`/`wrapInBlockType`/`addBlockType` with `view.state.schema.nodes`
  node types). **`/<language>`** (e.g. `/java` `/python` `/mermaid` `/js` `/c++`):
  when the query matches a known language alias (`LANGUAGES` table → canonical
  name), the generic "code" item is replaced by a "code · <lang>" item that
  inserts a `code_block` with `attrs.language` preset (Typora/Feishu behavior);
  `/mermaid` thus yields a diagram block (rendered via the code-block preview).
  The menu DOM mirrors Crepe's structure (`.milkdown-slash-menu` >
  `.menu-groups` > `.menu-group` > `h6` + `li[svg,span]`, `.hover`/`.active`) so it
  inherits Crepe's `block-edit.css` theme + the bounds-fixer in
  `editor-dom-bindings.js` (which keys off those classes).
- **Math**: enable `CrepeFeature.Latex` (off by default). Block math needs `$$` on
  their own lines. Long display math scrolls (`.katex-display { overflow-x:auto }`).
  Inline math `$x^2$` converts only on the closing `$` (Milkdown input rule
  `/\$([^$]+)\$/`), so there's no preview while typing the content. `editor-math-preview.js`
  (#45) adds a live KaTeX tooltip near the caret while typing an unclosed `$<mathy>`
  span — purely additive (reads state + renders a floating div, no typing change),
  wired via `prosePluginsCtx` (the channel for raw ProseMirror plugins; `crepe.editor.use`
  is for Milkdown FEATURES and silently breaks init if you pass a raw `Plugin`).
  Hides on non-empty selection, code blocks, blur, and non-mathy content (`$5`).
- **Raw ProseMirror plugins** (keymaps, view plugins like the math preview) go into
  `prosePluginsCtx` (`ctx.update(prosePluginsCtx, (plugins) => [...plugins, yours])`),
  NOT `crepe.editor.use(...)`. `crepe.editor.use` is for Milkdown `$nodeSchema`/`$inputRule`/features
  (highlight, frontmatter, inlineCodeSchema); a raw `new Plugin({...})` passed there
  silently breaks Crepe init (editor never mounts, no error). See `tableBreakKeymap()`
  + `mathPreviewPlugin()` for the pattern.
- **Table-cell line breaks** (`editor-tablebreak.js`): GFM cells are single-line,
  so a break must round-trip as `<br>`. A keymap inserts a hardbreak; a custom
  remark stringify `break` handler emits `<br>` **only inside `tableCell`** (else
  default); a remark transform parses inline `<br>` back to a break. Don't let a
  cell break serialize to a newline — it corrupts the table.
- **List conversion source fidelity**: right-click conversion owns only the
  current list level's marker/checkbox. Use the actual hit text position, build
  the converted canonical snapshot from the transaction document before
  dispatch, and patch only changed marker prefixes. `markdownUpdated` can arrive
  during dispatch, after the next keystroke, or at source flush; waiting for it
  and replacing the complete serializer list rewrites nested compact spacing and
  indentation. `npm run test:list-conversion-ui` must cover immediate human-like
  typing, source bytes, save, process exit and full reopen.
- **Forced rich flushes** must serialize `view.state.doc` with `serializerCtx`.
  `crepe.getMarkdown()` is a listener-backed snapshot and may lag behind a
  keyboard transaction that is already visible in ProseMirror; using it for an
  immediate save or source switch can lose the last input after reopen.
  `saveTab()` must call `getMarkdownForTab()` and update `tabsRef` before writing;
  `commitAllLive()` alone covers only uncontrolled source textareas.
- **Image host** (`ImageHostButton` + `image:upload` IPC): a Typora-style custom
  command. Renderer reads the file bytes and calls main, which writes a temp file,
  runs `<command> "<file>"`, and returns the last http(s) URL it prints. Empty
  command ⇒ paste/drop isn't intercepted (no dead blob: URLs). PicGo-Core
  (`picgo upload`) works directly as the command; the PicGo GUI app (no CLI) is
  reached by entering `picgo` (→ its local server `127.0.0.1:36677/upload`, #35).
  **Image-host URLs can be `http://`** (e.g. PicGo's `local-uploader` plugin returns
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...`), so the renderer CSP (`src/renderer/index.html`)
  `img-src` MUST include `http:` — without it those images render as broken
  (CSP-blocked), which presents as "pasted image doesn't display" even though the
  upload succeeded.
- **Renderer CSP** (`src/renderer/index.html`, the `Content-Security-Policy` meta):
  `img-src 'self' data: https: http: blob:` — `http:` is intentional (local picbeds
  / http image hosts, Typora-compatible). `script-src 'self'` (no `'unsafe-inline'`)
  and `default-src 'self'` stay strict. There is NO main-process CSP header
  override, so this meta is the single source — don't regress `http:` from img-src.
- **Unsaved scratch tabs persist**: the session stores untitled (pathless) tabs
  whose content is dirty under `untitled: [{title, content}]`, and the mount
  restore recreates them (with `savedContent: ''` so they stay marked unsaved).
  Saved files are still reopened from disk via `openPaths`. The onboarding/welcome
  doc is skipped if either `openPaths` or `untitled` is present.
- **State**: session is `localStorage["minimd.session.v1"]` (includes the selected
  `customTheme`); prefs (page width, image-host command) are
  `localStorage["horsemd.settings.v1"]` (`settings.js`); onboarding flag is
  `localStorage["horsemd.onboarded.v1"]`; dismissed update notice is
  `localStorage["horsemd.update.dismissed"]`. Themes are `body` classes
  (`light|dark` + optional `theme-*`), with custom themes as an injected `<style>`.
- **Find**: in-document find uses the **CSS Custom Highlight API**
  (`CSS.highlights` + `Highlight`), not `window.find` — it searches only the
  editor body (rich `view.dom` / source `<textarea>`), never UI text, and paints
  ranges without mutating the DOM. See `hooks/useFindReplace.js` and `find.js`.
- **Global search** (issue #120): the sidebar's third mode (`sidebarMode
  'search'`, ActivityBar button, `Mod+Shift+F`). Space-separated keywords are
  AND-matched per file in the main process (`search:workspace` reuses the
  sidebar's `listMarkdownFiles` scope + `isRestrictedWatchRoot` guard, with an
  mtime-validated content cache). Clicking a result opens the file and lands
  the in-document FindBar on that occurrence: source/plain tabs jump by
  `occIdx` (globalsearch-core counts occurrences with the EXACT find.js
  `matchIndices` semantics — case-insensitive, non-overlapping — so the index
  is exact), rich tabs call `restoreMarkdownOffset(fileOffset)` then pick the
  nearest highlighted range at/before the caret. Untitled tabs carry
  `path: null` — path comparisons must tolerate it.
- **File watcher must stay crash-proof.** chokidar recursively watching a tree
  with permission-protected paths throws a flood of `EACCES`/`EAGAIN`/`EBUSY`
  that, left unhandled, `abort()`s the whole main process on launch. The trap:
  a **relative** workspace path like `"."` resolves against the process CWD, which
  is `/` under Finder/launchd → it watches `/dev`, `/System/Volumes`, … (works in
  `npm run dev` only because the shell's CWD is the repo). So `watch:start` only
  watches **absolute** paths and refuses restricted roots (`isRestrictedRoot`:
  `/`, `.`, `..`, relative, `/dev`, `/System/Volumes`, …), ignores system trees,
  sets `followSymlinks:false`, and every watcher has an `'error'` handler; the
  renderer drops non-absolute/restricted folder roots (`sanitizeFolderRoots` +
  `isRestrictedPath` in `paths.js`, mirroring main's `isRestrictedRoot`); and a
  process-level `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` guard in `main/index.js`
  is the final safety net. Don't remove these. Also: main-process network calls
  use Electron's `net.fetch` (Chromium stack), not Node's global `fetch` (its
  c-ares resolver can abort an unsigned app under launchd).
- **Don't commit `dist/` or `out/`** (gitignored). `build/icon.*` IS tracked.
- **Font settings (#38)**: `settings.fontWrite` / `settings.fontMono` (empty =
  default stack) are applied as inline CSS vars `--font-write` / `--font-mono` on
  the `.app` root div (so they beat `body.light/dark` AND the `.app.is-win`
  Consolas override). `fontStack(name, base)` in `settings.js` prepends the
  user font (quoted) to the default stack. The settings **preview** must
  explicitly use `var(--font-write)` (it inherits `body`'s `--font-ui` by
  default, which is the CHROME font, not the document font — without the override
  the preview silently ignores the document-font setting).
- **CodeMirror `--font-mono` fix**: CodeMirror's default theme hard-codes
  `.cm-content { font-family: monospace }`. Without an explicit override, the
  `--font-mono` CSS var NEVER reaches fenced code blocks — which is why #34's
  Windows Consolas override didn't fix curly quotes AND why a custom code font
  wouldn't apply. The rule `.milkdown .cm-editor .cm-content, .cm-line {
  font-family: var(--font-mono) }` (in app.css, specificity beats CM's default)
  is the root fix — don't remove it.
- **CodeMirror long-code copy**: CodeMirror virtualizes long code blocks, so
  `.cm-line` contains only the visible window (often 30–65 lines). Whole-block
  copy must resolve the complete ProseMirror `code_block`; never fall back to
  DOM text, and never show success after a partial/failed resolution. Keep
  native CodeMirror selection copy untouched, then run `npm run test:issue-98-ui`
  for the 122-line whole-copy and 65-line partial-selection cases. Full report:
  `docs/long-code-copy-virtualization-regression.md`.
- **queryLocalFonts (Local Font Access API)**: the Settings font pickers
  enumerate installed system fonts via `window.queryLocalFonts()` on first
  focus/click (needs a user gesture). Permission is granted in `main/index.js`
  via `session.defaultSession.setPermissionRequestHandler` + `setPermissionCheckHandler`
  (grant-all — safe for a local editor; Markdown content isn't executed as JS).
- **FontPicker** (inline in `SettingsView.jsx`): a button trigger showing the
  current font in its own glyph + a popover with a search box + scrollable list
  where each font is previewed in its own font. **Hover-preview**: `hoverFont`
  state in `App.jsx` temporarily overrides `settings.fontWrite/fontMono` while
  the cursor is over an option (cleared on leave/close/pick). Pinned footer at
  the dropdown bottom links to font sites (doc → foundertype.com, code →
  nerdfonts.com).
- **`useColDrag` hook** (`hooks/useColDrag.js`): shared horizontal-drag helper
  for the split-pane divider + the outline/file-tree resizer. Both used to
  hand-roll the same mousemove/mouseup + body-class dance. onStart returns state
  (e.g. mousedown x / start width) passed to onMove as 2nd arg.
- **PDF visual fidelity**: PDF Studio renders the same final PDF Buffer that is
  saved to disk. Do not validate layout only from source HTML or print CSS.
  Body font size is a separate 8–24pt setting (11pt default); overall scale
  still scales the complete page, while headings, tables, code, and spacing
  remain relative to the body size.
  Table export preserves measured total width and column ratios, while
  `th/td > p` margins stay reset so document paragraph spacing cannot inflate
  rows. Follow [`docs/pdf-visual-fidelity-runbook.md`](./docs/pdf-visual-fidelity-runbook.md)
  for final-PDF X/Y coordinate checks, PNG rendering, regression commands, and
  handoff stop conditions.
- **PDF preview cancellation**: latest-request-only does not mean destroying a
  BrowserWindow during `printToPDF()`. Chromium can reject the Promise before
  its native print backend has recovered, causing the next request to fail with
  `Printing failed`. Let active printing finish, discard stale output, and wait
  for the worker's asynchronous cleanup before starting the latest request.
- **Document export subsystem** (PDF / HTML / Pandoc / AI): three independent
  output pipelines. PDF and HTML share the structured editor snapshot
  `{ html, headings, title, images }` from `editor-pdf-content.js`
  (`getPdfSource()`/`getExportSource()`) but have **separate templates and
  settings** — never paste PDF print CSS into the HTML template. Pandoc does
  **not** use the snapshot: it reads the active tab's raw Markdown only (source
  textarea live buffer, or `flushMarkdown()` in rich mode — never a stale React
  tab snapshot), and export must not change dirty/cursor/disk. See
  [`docs/document-export-architecture.md`](./docs/document-export-architecture.md).
- **HTML export** (`html-export.js` + `html-document.js`): the main-process
  preview returns an opaque token; the saved file is the SAME bytes the token
  refers to (no re-render on save). Output is no-script: the snapshot strips
  dangerous nodes/attrs, the template ships a strict CSP, the renderer preview
  is a no-permission sandbox iframe. Latest-request-only like PDF.
- **Pandoc export** (`pandoc-export.js` + `pandoc-core.js` + `subprocess.js`):
  the executable is verified by absolute path + `--version`; the target format
  is a whitelist; args are built main-side; Markdown goes via stdin; `shell:
  false`; 2-min timeout. The source file's directory is passed as
  `--resource-path` so relative images resolve. Only the chosen executable
  path is persisted (`userData/document-tools.json`).
- **AI Phase 0** (`src/shared/ai-contracts.js` + `src/main/ai/`): pure, no-UI,
  no-network contracts (`AiRequest`, `ProviderAdapter`, `ContextSnapshot` with
  sha256 revision, `ChangeProposal` with before-check + stale refusal). **Not
  user-facing yet** — future Provider/key/network/UI must not bypass revision
  validation and `ChangeProposal`. See
  [`docs/ai-vmark-phase-plan.md`](./docs/ai-vmark-phase-plan.md).
- **Export save-dir remembering** (`export-prefs.js` + `export-prefs-logic.js`):
  PDF/HTML/Pandoc save dialogs default to the source Markdown's folder, and the
  choice is remembered **per file** — the same file keeps its chosen folder, but
  a different file still defaults to its own folder (do NOT use a single global
  last-dir); untitled docs fall back to a global last dir. Persisted in
  `userData/export-prefs.json`. The pure decision logic is split into
  `export-prefs-logic.js` so `scripts/test-export-prefs.mjs` can lock the
  per-file semantics without Electron.
- **PDF density** (`PDF_DENSITY_VALUES` in `src/shared/pdf-options.js` +
  `pdf-print-styles.js`): a comfort/standard/compact preset. The 12 spacing
  rules (body line-height, para/heading/list/li/blockquote/figure/img/math/hr
  margins) are CSS vars (`var(--hm-pdf-*, literal)`); `standard`'s values ARE
  the pre-density literals, so the default renders identically — validate via
  the rendered PDF, **not a CSS string diff** (the string changes because of
  `var()`). Heading line-height (1.3), code (1.6) and table-cell (1.4)
  line-heights + the `th/td > p { margin:0 }` reset stay **hardcoded** (not
  density levers — protects table measurement + heading hierarchy). Note `em`
  margins do NOT scale with `line-height` (em is font-size-relative), so ALL
  spacing rules must be parameterized for uniform compactness. Persist only
  `densityPreset` (`settings.lastPdfDensityPreset`), **not the whole options
  bag** (header/footer/title/page-ranges are per-document and must not leak
  across docs). The live page-count estimate is the preview's real `numPages`,
  lifted via an `onPageCount` callback. Locked by `scripts/test-pdf-density.mjs`.

## Testing

There is no single `npm test` command. The repository has deterministic Node
tests plus hidden, isolated Electron/CDP UI sessions. Run `npm run build` before
focused tests and use `npm run test:ui-regression` for editor/PDF/UI changes;
the suite currently covers seven sessions plus standalone regressions. Input
rules and source-fidelity tests type one character at a time through
`scripts/lib/human-input.mjs`. See [`docs/development.md`](./docs/development.md).

On macOS, scripting `osascript "tell application \"Electron\""` can launch the
generic `node_modules` Electron bundle. Automated regression must use
`scripts/lib/electron-test-app.mjs` in background mode; user handoff must rebuild,
install and verify the current `/Applications/HorseMD.app`.

## When in doubt

Read the matching doc in `docs/` before changing a subsystem — many non-obvious
behaviors (editor data flow, drag regions, watcher echo suppression, the
title-bar layout) are documented there with their root causes.
